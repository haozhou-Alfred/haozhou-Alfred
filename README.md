- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @haozhou-Alfred
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming & statistics. Also, I love guitar and Stella. Jazz always heals me. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning swift programming and data structure. Pretty difficult for me, but I'll stick on them.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - haoz-zhou@outlook.com. I'll use Github to record the way that I learn by myself to be a SDE.
